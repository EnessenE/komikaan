# Komikaan.nl
The repository for the website [komikaan.nl](https://komikaan.nl). The website is fully in dutch at the moment (I promise i18n support) but he backend code is not. Everything is written in English except for data models from the data supplier. There we are bound to whatever they provide us.
If you end up contributing, please follow provided standards.
# Frontend
The frontend can be found in [EnessenE/komikaan-webapp](https://github.com/EnessenE/komikaan).
# How to run
Simply open the .sln file. If you use Visual Studio then it should guide you along with what else you need.
